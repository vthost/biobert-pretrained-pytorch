# BioBERT Pre-trained Weights for PyTorch
This repository provides a PyTorch version of the pre-trained weights of BioBERT, a language representation model for the biomedical domain, proposed in [(Lee et al. 2019)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.08746). 

Please go to the [release section](https://github.com/vthost/biobert-pytorch/releases) to download the models. The original TensorFlow models can be found [here](https://github.com/naver/biobert-pretrained).

The [DMIS GitHub repository for BioBERT](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert) provides details about BioBERT.

## License and Disclaimer
Please see the LICENSE file for details. Downloading the weights indicates your acceptance of our disclaimer.

## Contact information
For help or issues using the pre-trained weights, please submit a GitHub issue. We only used our pre-trained models for question answering so far, so we most likely cannot help with other tasks. For more general questions about BioBERT, please refer to the [DMIS GitHub repository for BioBERT](https://github.com/dmis-lab/biobert).
